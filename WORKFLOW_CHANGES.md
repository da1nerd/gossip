# ðŸš€ Workflow Changes Summary

## Overview

The release workflow has been dramatically simplified by migrating to **Melos 7.x** and **pub workspaces**. The complex 140+ line bash scripts have been replaced with simple one-line commands that leverage Melos's built-in versioning capabilities.

## ðŸ”„ What Changed

### Before: Complex Manual Process
```bash
# Old approach - 140+ lines of bash scripts
./scripts/update_versions.sh patch
melos bootstrap
# Complex dependency management
# Platform-specific sed commands
# Manual error handling
```

### After: Simple Melos Commands
```bash
# New approach - single command with automatic dependency management
dart run melos version gossip patch --yes
```


## ðŸ“š Migration Commands

### New Workflow Process

#### 1. Release Workflow (Manual)
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub Actions UI or:
gh workflow run release.yml -f release_type=patch
gh workflow run release.yml -f release_type=minor
gh workflow run release.yml -f release_type=major

# Or locally:
dart run melos run version-patch  # Creates git tag automatically
dart run melos run version-minor  # Creates git tag automatically
dart run melos run version-major  # Creates git tag automatically
```

#### 2. Publishing Workflow (Automatic)
```bash
# Automatically triggered when git tag is created
# No manual intervention needed!

# For testing locally:
dart run melos run publish-dry-run
dart run melos run publish-packages  # Only after tag creation
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# List packages and versions
dart run melos list
dart pub workspace list

# Run tests across packages
dart run melos run test

# Format and analyze
dart run melos run format
dart run melos run analyze
```
